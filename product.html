        <h2>Apple MacBook Air M2</h2>
        <h5> July 7, 2022</h5>
      </header>

        <span>
          <h5>Story about the product </h5>
           <p>The MacBook Air (M2, 2022) infuses the groundbreaking ultraportable Air design with the performance and battery-life enhancements of Apple’s M2 chip, all in a super-slim aluminum chassis that weighs less than 3 pounds. The 13-inch Retina display looks great, the keyboard and trackpad are solid, and Touch ID offers seamless, convenient security for Apple’s most affordable Mac laptop.

          </p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>Apple’s M2 chip has plenty of things going for it, with ample performance for everyday use and even some media editing, but it does so while sipping power and running silently—there are no noisy fans in the Air, and the performance is still top-notch. The M2 Air offers great capabilities and decent battery life, making it the go-to choice for Apple fans and Windows refugees alike.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>For Who</h5>
           <p>If your needs are relatively simple and your targeted spend is much closer to $500 than $1,000, you can’t beat what this laptop has to offer. True budget laptops usually include some sort of compromise, so the best budget systems minimize them as much as possible, and the shortcomings here aren't dealbreakers. PC costs have risen steadily in the past couple years, so if a bargain is your main concern and you just need a laptop for light everyday use cases, look no further.</p>
           <h5>Future innovation</h5>
           <p>If you’re an Apple die-hard, or even just ambivalent towards Windows, then the M2 Apple MacBook Air is the general-use laptop we recommend. But it's not the cheapest Mac laptop; that would be the M1 version of the MacBook Air, which starts at $999 and might be a better choice if you prioritize saving money over the additional benefits that the M2 provides.</p>

        <h2>Microsoft Surface Pro 8</h2>
        <h5> September 15, 2022</h5>
      </header>
      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage2.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Story about the product </h5>
           <p>The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 improves on what was already the best Windows tablet, bringing users a detachable 2-in-1 that refines and polishes the design with new thinner bezels, a sleeker chassis, and great performance from an 11th Generation Intel Core i7 processor. It’s not a revolutionary redesign, but it’s a meaningful update from previous models. Unfortunately, despite the system’s price, the key accessories like the keyboard and pen are still sold separately—and they aren’t cheap.</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>The updated design is made of sturdy anodized aluminum, and the integrated kickstand is still an elegant solution to the problem of keeping a tablet upright. The new keyboard cover includes a storage and charging slot for the improved pen, and Windows 11 includes features and pen interaction that’s second to none. Combine that with great performance and a battery that lasts more than 12 hours, and this is the paragon of modern Windows tablets.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>For Who</h5>
           <p>The average shopper who wants a quick, portable, and low-fuss system doesn't need to look further. It's particularly friendly to those who can extend their budget beyond the low starting price for some of those fast and fancy upgrade options. There are bigger-screen alternatives if that's your priority, but if you’re looking for a light portable laptop for everyday home and office tasks, a fair starting price (with room to configure up), and reliable all-around performance, this is the best value around.</h5>
            <h5>Future innovation</h5>
           <p>If you want a 2-in-1 tablet and don't mind spending extra for a keyboard cover and other accessories, this is it. It's simply the best, combining the iconic Windows tablet with smooth pen integration and an updated thin-bezel design.</p>

        <h2>Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max</h2>
        <h5> September 30, 2022</h5>
      </header>
      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage3.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Story about the product </h5>
           <p>The iPhone 14 Pro Max (starting at $1,099) is Apple's largest, most tricked-out handset, and the top pick in the iPhone family for anyone who wants a do-it-all smartphone. The smaller iPhone 14 Pro is $100 less, but we think the larger screen and longer-lasting battery you get with the Max are worth the extra cash. .</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>Moreover, the Pro Max outshines the standard iPhone 14 thanks to its more capable processor, always-on display, and Dynamic Island. With an upgraded main camera powered by a new Photonic Engine, and safety features such as Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite, Apple has delivered as fine a device as any on the market, earning the iPhone 14 Pro Max our Editors' Choice award.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>For Who</h5>
           <p>The phone measures 6.33 by 3.05 by 0.31 inches (HWD) and weighs 8.47 ounces—dimensions that are within fractions of a millimeter and just 0.01 ounces changed from last year's model. That makes it a large and heavy device, but Pro Max buyers should be well used to these dimensions and weight by now. It's about on par with the Google Pixel 6 Pro (6.45 by 2.99 by 0.35 inches) and Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (6.43 by 3.07 by 0.35 inches) in terms of size.</h5>
            <h5>Future innovation</h5>
           <p>While the design isn't particularly exciting, Apple continues to lead the market with materials and build quality. The iPhone 14 Pro Max features a stainless steel frame (as opposed to the standard iPhone 14's aluminum) and is protected with the company's own Ceramic Shield. Apple says its Shield is stronger than competing glass, but that's not something we can test in a practical manner.</p>

        <h2>Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</h2>
        <h5> june, 15 2022</h5>
      </header>
      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage4.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Story about the product </h5>
           <p>The Galaxy Note is back in a big way, even if not by name. Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra (starting at $1,199.99) exhibits all the hallmark features of the Note lineup, with a big build, powerful hardware, long battery life, and, of course, a built-in S Pen stylus. The new model performs better than the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra from last year.</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>As well as the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (albeit slightly), and is an excellent choice if you want the most phone possible. That said, of the three Galaxy S22 models, the S22+ gets our top recommendation for delivering most of the same features as the Ultra at a lower price and in a more reasonably sized design.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>For Who</h5>
           <p>Despite its name, the Galaxy S22 Ultra takes its design cues from the Galaxy Note lineup. Whereas devices in the Galaxy S series have softer curves, Galaxy Note models typically sport squared-off top and bottom edges with curved, waterfall sides.</h5>
            <h5>Future innovation</h5>
           <p>The S22 Ultra's 6.8-inch screen has 3,088-by-1,440-pixel resolution, which you can reduce to 2,316 by 1,080 or even 1,544 by 720 to conserve battery. With a 1,200-nit maximum brightness rating and an algorithm that changes not only brightness but also screen contrast in sunlight, the panel is particularly suitable for outdoor use.</p>

        <h2>Canon EOS R</h2>
        <h5>October 15, 2021</h5>
      </header>
      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage5.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Story about the product </h5>
           <p>The Canon EOS R7 ($1,499, body only) is the spiritual successor to the company's well-regarded and long-running sports-and-wildlife specialist, the EOS 7D Mark II. The R7 swaps an optical viewfinder for an EVF, expands autofocus coverage across the entire frame, and boosts its accuracy with intelligent subject recognition for people, animals, and vehicles.</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>A high-resolution sensor with 5-axis IBIS and support for 4K60 video rounds out its feature set. Although its image sensor doesn't wow us like the high-end EOS R3, from which the R7 derives its autofocus acumen, nearly everything else about the camera does; it's the model to get if you've been waiting for a mirrorless update to the 7D Mark II.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>For Who</h5>
           <p>Canon's EOS R system started with full-frame models, but the company recently expanded into the APS-C space with the more consumer-friendly EOS R10 and R7. The smaller sensor supports lighter lenses—two zoom lenses, the RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM and the RF-S 18-150mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM, launched alongside them.</h5>
            <h5>Future innovation</h5>
           <p>The EOS R7 sports all the hallmarks of an enthusiast camera, with a dust-and-moisture protected chassis that uses a mix of magnesium alloy and engineering-grade plastic. You also get plenty of on-body controls, dual memory card slots, and a fast burst rate for action photography.

        <h2>Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 VII</h2>
        <h5> October 15, 2020</h5>
      </header>
      <figure class="proimg">
        <img src="img/products/productpage6.jpg" alt="pc1" style="width:25%">
        <span>
          <h5>Story about the product </h5>
           <p>The Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 VII is, simply put, the best pocket camera out there. It sports a big Type 1 sensor for blurred backgrounds and good results in tough light, along with a long 24-200mm equivalent zoom for versatile coverage and a clever pop-up viewfinder.</p>
           <h5>Public expaction</h5>
           <p>The RX100 VII is a camera for die-hard photogs who want a quality camera with a pocketable form factor, price be damned. Its lens covers a wide range of angles, so you can get an epic landscape views and zoom in on the local fauna, too.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
          <h5>For Who</h5>
           <p>The EOS R10 is the most affordable entry-point to the EOS R system, but it offers much better than basic performance. We love its versatility as an easy-to-use automatic camera for beginners and a fully manual one for long-time enthusiasts.</h5>
            <h5>Future innovation</h5>
           <p>Creators looking to jump into the EOS R system who put more preference on fast focus over the slower-but-full-frame EOS RP can look to the R10 as an affordable entry point. It's the mirrorless body that makes the most sense for EOS Rebel owners mulling an upgrade.</p>
